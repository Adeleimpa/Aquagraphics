How to run code ? (assuming you have everything to use OpenGL)

(I run it on Ubuntu)

1. Download code on your computer
3. Open terminal window in folder 'Code' of Aquagraphics
4. Remove 'build' folder
5. mkdir build
6. cd build
7. cmake ..
8. cd ..

Once you've done that you can you compile and run like that:
9. cmake â€”build build
10. cd waterRendering
11. ./waterRendering
